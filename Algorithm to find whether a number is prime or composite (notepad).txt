Algorithm to find whether a number is prime or composite 

1.Start
2.accept positive integers(number greater than two)
3.Initialize counter variable with value 2
4.Divide the number with counter value 
5.If the reminder is zero display that 'n' is composite and stop
6.If the reminder is not zero, else increment the 'counter' and repeat from step 4 until the 'counter' value is less than n
7.after completion of all the steps display that a number 'n' is prime
8.Stop
